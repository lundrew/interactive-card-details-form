# Interactive Card Details Form

## 1. Description

The reason I built this applciation was to practice my front end skills with React and Forms. As a user, you can fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time. A user should also recieve error messages when the form is submitted if any input field is empty and if the card number/expiry date/CVC fields are in the wrong format. The web page should also display the optimal layout depending on the user's device screen size. Lastly, the user can see hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page.

## 2. How to Install and Run the Project

This project was built with React. To run the application, run the following command.

### `yarn start`

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## 3. Running Tests
